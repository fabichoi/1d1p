# 1d1p (One day, One Problem)
Solving a problem per a day. <br>
If I could solve a dp(dynamic programming) problem, I'd solved it. <br>
But If I couldn't do that, I'd be solving the problem again without previous source. <br> 
When I don't have enough time to solve problem, I'd just commit with attendance book. <br>
